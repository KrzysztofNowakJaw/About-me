Hi everyone. My name is Krzysztof Nowak, maybe some people remember me from the Quarto course. I deal with process automation on a daily basis, but I'm broadening my horizons and looking for more analytical challenges, hence my presence here. You can contact me through my profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/krzysztofnowakdata/ 
Greetings
